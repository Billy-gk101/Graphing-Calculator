# Graphing-Calculator
Attempt at creating a expanding calculator for Pre-Algebra thru Calculous; recreating wheel but for my education/practice
Usure of correct license as this is a WIP (Work in Progress) you must note that this does use Qt and matplotlib for the GUI so that needs to be considered

This is not intended for commercial use, feel free to use as allowed via dependancy licenses; I take no legal responsibility inpart or whole for others use of this.

I'll be reading through 'https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/' to learr about creating a setup.py as seen with other projects; I'm rather new to Packaging Python Projects; so this directoy structure and other parts may change without notice (again, this is a WIP)
